# My Java Learning Journey 👩‍💻

Hey! I'm Hemapriya. I’m currently learning Java from scratch while getting ready to restart my career in tech after a break.

I’m using this repo to track my progress, try out small projects, and slowly get comfortable with coding again. My goal is to become a Java developer and start building real-world backend apps.

## What I'm Learning 📚

Here are some free resources I’ve been following:

- Java basics from Great Learning
- Java + DSA for interviews from Scaler
- A full beginner course on YouTube by BroCode

## Projects I'm Planning to Build

- Simple BMI calculator in Java
- A small expense tracker
- Reminder app for baby vaccinations (still thinking about this one)

Just keeping track of how far I’ve come:
