# My Java Learning Journey 👩‍💻

Hey! I'm Hemapriya. I’m currently learning Java from scratch while getting ready to restart my career in tech after a break.

I’m using this repo to track my progress, try out small projects, and slowly get comfortable with coding again. My goal is to become a Java developer and start building real-world backend apps.

---

## What I'm Learning 📚

Here are some free resources I’ve been following:

- Java basics from Great Learning
- Java + DSA for interviews from Scaler
- A full beginner course on YouTube by BroCode

---

## Projects I'm Planning to Build

- Simple BMI calculator in Java
- A small expense tracker
- Reminder app for baby vaccinations (still thinking about this one)

---

## Progress Log 📅

Just keeping track of how far I’ve come:

| Week | Topics Covered            | Status |
|------|----------------------------|--------|
| 1    | Java syntax, variables     | ✅ Done |
| 2    | Loops, functions, OOP      | 🕒 Ongoing |
| 3    | Arrays, basic DSA          | ⏳ Coming up |

## Setup and Completed Tasks ✅

## Setup and Completed Tasks ✅

Here’s what I’ve completed so far to get started:

- **Installed Java and IntelliJ IDEA** on my system.
- **Set up GitHub account** to track and share my code.
- Created a **Trello board** to plan my learning tasks and milestones.
- Organized my learning into **Trello lists** to stay focused on progress.

### 📅 May 4, 2025 – Progress Update
- Wrote and ran my first Java program: `HelloWorld.java` 🎉  
- Practiced using variables with different data types: `int`, `double`, `char`, and `boolean`.  
- Successfully pushed my `/java_basics/HelloWorld.java` file to GitHub from IntelliJ IDEA.  
- Feeling confident and ready to move deeper into Java Basics tomorrow!

✅ May 13,14, 2025 – Progress Update

- # 🏦 Smart ATM – Mini Java Project

A simple console-based ATM simulation project built using core Java concepts.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project mimics a basic ATM machine where users can log in, check their account balance, deposit money, or withdraw money. It’s built entirely using Java fundamentals without external libraries, making it beginner-friendly.

---

## 🔑 Features

- ✅ **Password Login Simulation** – Users must enter a correct password to access the ATM.
- ✅ **Check Balance** – Displays the current account balance.
- ✅ **Deposit** – Adds money to the account with a maximum deposit limit of ₹50,000.
- ✅ **Withdraw** – Allows withdrawal with a maximum limit of ₹10,000, only if balance is sufficient.
- ❌ **(Skipped)** Transaction history – This feature will be added after learning LinkedLists.

## 💡 Concepts Used

- `Scanner` for input handling
- `while` loops for menu navigation
- `switch-case` for menu selection
- `if-else` for logic decisions
- Variables and data types (`double`, `boolean`, `int`)
- Basic input validation and user feedback

## 📘 What I Learned

- Writing clean, structured code using Java basics.
- Using control flow structures effectively in a real-world scenario.
- Handling user input and validations.
- Designing a project with a user-friendly experience in the console.
