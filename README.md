# My Java Learning Journey 👩‍💻

Hey! I'm Hemapriya. I’m currently learning Java from scratch while getting ready to restart my career in tech after a break.

I’m using this repo to track my progress, try out small projects, and slowly get comfortable with coding again. My goal is to become a Java developer and start building real-world backend apps.

## What I'm Learning 📚

Here are some free resources I’ve been following:

- Java basics from Great Learning
- Java + DSA for interviews from Scaler
- A full beginner course on YouTube by BroCode

---

## Projects I'm Planning to Build

- Simple BMI calculator in Java
- A small expense tracker
- Reminder app for baby vaccinations (still thinking about this one)

## Setup and Completed Tasks ✅

Here’s what I’ve completed so far to get started:

- **Installed Java and IntelliJ IDEA** on my system.
- **Set up GitHub account** to track and share my code.
- Created a **Trello board** to plan my learning tasks and milestones.
- Organized my learning into **Trello lists** to stay focused on progress.

### 📅 May 4, 2025 – Progress Update
- Wrote and ran my first Java program: `HelloWorld.java` 🎉  
- Practiced using variables with different data types: `int`, `double`, `char`, and `boolean`.  
- Successfully pushed my `/java_basics/HelloWorld.java` file to GitHub from IntelliJ IDEA.  
- Feeling confident and ready to move deeper into Java Basics tomorrow!

  
## Notes

This repo is mostly for me to stay consistent and motivated. Hoping to improve little by little every week.
